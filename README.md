# Rice-PCA-SNPs



Welcome! This repo contains an analysis of SNP data from the RNA sequencing of many rice genomes. This workflow was adapted from the Genomics Laboratory course BIS 180L at UC Davis. This repo contains part of a wider analysis of the rice RNA seq data. More specifically, this repo contains:

* Making PCA and MDS plots from SNP data
* Assigning sub populations using fastStructure
* Exploring the relationship between fastStructure populations and PCA plots

The analyses conducted in this repo of the rice sequencing data will subsequently be used for a GWAS.
